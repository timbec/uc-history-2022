This is the latest theme for the website at: 

(Uranium City History)[https://uraniumcity-histor.com]

Uranium City is a mining town in northern Saskatchewan. Or perhaps I should say former mining town, since the last mine closed in 1982, and the town's population dropped from 4000 to 400 in six months, and now posseses less than a hundred full time resident. 

Uranium City, as the name may imply, was a Cold War town, initially fuelling the US and British nuclear arsenals. In 1959, both government cancelled their contracts and the town collapsed for the first time, saved only by the Canadian government stockpiling uranium for their Candu Reactor. By the mid '60s, the Canadian government outlawed the sale of Canadian uranium for military purposes so Uranium City was a cold town no more. 

I grew up in Uranium City, left just before the mine closed. It was a colourful town in a colourful era, an important part of the Great Canadian frontier. This project grows out of a documentary film I was trying to make about the town in the late '90s and early '00s, when I visited the town several times, shot footage, interviewed townspeople. For various reasons, the film was never finished: this website is the follow-up. 

As such, I'm trying to collect stories, photos, video, whatever I can, to document that history and keep it alive. 

**Technical details:**

This is a hybrid theme, both utilizing custom blocks and default Wordpress. The main use of blocks will be on the front page, and in the 'Places' section: 

(Gunnar Mines Part 1)[http://uraniumcity-history.com/places/gunnar-part-1/]

The idea behind these Places is to allow for a custom format, depending on the content, mimicking magazine layouts like those found on, say, the New York Times or the Guardian. Obviously I don't have the resources of these publications, but that is the general idea - to create flexible, readable and attractive-looking content. 

The front page follows more or the same pattern, although in this case I want to be able reconfigure the content when necessary - have a slider, or a hero image, have different content boxes (news, places) depending on what I think is most important. 

Custom blocks include: 

- banner
- photo/photo gallery with lightbox included
- Home page slider/banner
- PDF embed (something visually more appealing than the default 'file' block)
- inline/sidebar images

This site will also include custom plugins: 

- Related Posts (allowing for choice by CPT)
- Some sort of comment filter plugin (to allow for display of relevant or engaging comments, as opposed to ALL comments)
