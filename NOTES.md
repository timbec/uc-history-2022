basic notes: 

for full-size banner images (make helper class): 

https://gomakethings.com/how-to-break-an-image-out-of-its-parent-container-with-css/#:~:text=The%20.&text=full%2Dwidth%20%2C%20will%20break%20the,(%20vw%20)%20unit%20of%20measure.&text=Add%20it%20to%20your%20image%2C%20and%20the%20CSS%20handles%20the%20rest.

TO DO: 

1) need related posts feature, either plugin or block
2) banner images more consistent
3) format front page
4) Comments plugin. EITHER a custom query to the database, or a block, with a custom API call. How to filter? 
EITHER - latest comments from people not me 
OR     -  comments I can flag somewhow as worth putting on front page (or elsewhere)
